# Web Scraping Chrome Extension

This is a chrome extension to work with a my unnammed web scraping application. 

As of now, my design idea is to use a minimal amount of JavaScript to get a user's choice of HTML tag or CSS selector, send this and the address of the current webpage they are visiting to the appropriate fields of my flask web application and return the results.
